Simon is NOT doing well here in the shelter. When Simon came to us he was a big goofball, unfortunately the stresses of being in a shelter environment for an extended period of time are proving to be too much for him. \nSimon has developed some undesirable behaviors. HOWEVER, we firmly believe that outside the shelter setting, these behaviors would significantly improve. Simon is not a bad boy, he is just trying to cope with his current situation the best way he knows how. \n\nSimon is looking for an adoptive home or foster home with an experienced owner, with no small animals and no children . He needs consistency and patience. \n\n**Please understand Simon is a special case and is looking for a dog experienced home that will give him the time, energy and patience (that's a big one) needed to correct his bad behaviors** \nAgain, he is NOT a bad boy, he is just reacting badly to his situation.\nIf you can help Simon become the best version of himself please fill out an application so we may set up a meet and greet!",

    "description": "Meet Miss Thea Queen! This beautiful girl has been with us at Wanderer's for quite some time now, and by \"quite some time we mean she just passed 400 days as being a resident here at the shelter. \nWhy? Well, that's a great question with a complex answer. \nLike MOST dogs Thea is absolutely terrified, which more then likely is presented as aggression when inside her kennel. The primary reason for this is because her kennel is HER HOME. She is a young dog whose life prior to the shelter we have no knowledge of; meaning for all we know she could have escaped an inadequate living environment, OR she could have possibly had a great home. We'll never know, but that's okay!\nWith the being said, imagine being in a foreign place, your new living quarters doesn't have windows and only one way out that's locked and requires thumbs to open (now imagine being a dog for that part). Then imagine having to use the restroom but being unable to actually use the restroom. That's what it's like in the minds of most shelter dogs, you'd be a wreck too. Even though Thea is a Queen she can be a bit dramatic when meeting new people. Initially she can become defensive, definitely scared, and she'll even cower in the back end of her kennel. Maybe she'll let out a bark or 4 that doesn't show you who she actually is, what she's saying is \"HEY! The Queen doesn't know you!!! \nOur Thea here has required a bit of work to get her to where she is right now, we couldn't be more proud of her and how far she's come! After spending lots and lots of quality time with Thea we've learned so many wonderful things about her that truly did shock us! She is STRONG, but eager with a secret submissive side. She just absolutely loves laying out in the grass, all splayed out like a frog, you can truly see the happiness in her facial expression and the bliss in her eyes, it's truly a sight to see. Another fan favorite of Theas is WATER, she could spend all day in the kiddy pools, she'll wade in the water and even lay in it for an impressive amount of time too. It usually takes place after she's had an intense tug-o-war match, or fetch! She fancy's both, but her absolute favorite toys are squeaky stuffed animals, any species she doesn't have a preference, as long as she can rip it to shreds and show them who the real Queen is she's happy. You'd think she would have slipped a disk or given herself whiplash with how intensely she shakes her head back and forth.\nTheas adopter is required to continue her current obedience training. They'll need to have a very clear understanding of what it takes to properly care for her. Consistency is key for Theas success. It's highly suggested that her new owner is a single male, Thea responds impressively well to the depth of a mans voice and seemed to start obeying commands much quicker opposed to female handlers. Although it's not impossible for a women to gain her trust. \nGetting to know Thea will also require and consist of multiple visits to the shelter to guarantee a perfect fit. Thea is full of excitement and enthusiasm for every possible adventure! Will you be joining our Queen as her King? Guess you'll have to come and meet her for yourself! By appointment only, of course, being royalty and all.",

I am hand shy and will take a moment to warm up to you, but once I do, I am very sweet!  \n\nThere is an adoption process along with a donation.\n\nPlease bring your dog (if you have one), and a martingale collar with a leash, should we move forward.  We recycle theirs for the next dog :)  I have attached a picture of a martingale collar.  If you cannot find one, we do sell them at the daycare for 10-15.  Purchasing one from us allows us to fit it properly and it helps to benefit the rescue.  We carry leashes too, the collar and leash set are 30.  Adoption donations vary depending on the dog's age and medical expenses.  Typically they start at 650 and go up from there.  We realize this is a larger donation, however we have no state funding like shelters do.  That being said, dogs do come to you fully vetted.  They have been fixed, given distemper, bordetella, rabies, heartworm tested, de-wormed, on prevention for heartworm, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites and microchipped.  Additionally we have paid for the microchip registration for life. \n\n*Please note we make every effort to have our dogs altered prior to adoption, if we cannot spay/neuter clauses will be in the contract.\n\n*Please come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to meet us!\n\nThank you for choosing rescue! \n\nDon't forget to like us and follow us on Facebook, we get new animals in regularly.\n\n*Please submit an application here: http://goo.gl/forms/XPuk6w9615GXqo0x2 and come down to the Dog Gone Inn in Manlius to see me or (315) 728-9344 or www.DogGoneInn.com or DogGoneInn@Yahoo.com or www.facebook.com/DogGoneInn",
